# 删除无用代码
1. 减轻新成员压力

For anyone new working on a project, they not only have to understand the working code, they have to understand unused material also. This is wasted time and creates confusion.

2. 减少因重构代码、复用代码带来的误用

There is a danger that at sometime someone will make a change which inadvertently involve the 'dormant' code and can introduce bugs. I know it's happened on projects I've worked on.

3. 无用代码会越来越多，对项目是个不小的负担
The maintenance of any code is an administrative burden. By preserving old redundant code that burden is increased. For example, merging changes in the main branch becomes harder because there is more code to work through and more possibility to make a mistake.

What happens over time is that more and more old unused code is added to the codebase. This increases the confusion, potential misunderstanding and administrative overhead.

4. 无用代码很少再被使用
The chances that the unused code will ever be used again is very unlikely. With time that possibility of re-use diminishes. If code is to be removed and is considered important enough then the code can be branched off and documented.

5. 无用代码让人费解
Any personal feelings that a coder may have about code they may have worked hard on are understandable. But part of being professional requires that those thoughts have to be put to one side for the better good. Time stands for no-one and there is no place for preserving historical code in a working codebase.
